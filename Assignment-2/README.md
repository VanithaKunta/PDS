Question 1:

The sample mean glucose value of 128.12 is higher than the population mean glucose value of 120.89. This suggests that the sample may have a slightly higher average glucose level than the population.

The sample highest glucose value of 179 is lower than the population highest glucose value of 199. This could mean that the sample may not include individuals with extremely high glucose levels that are present in the population. 

Question 2:

The sample 98th percentile of BMI (41.796) is lower than the population 98th percentile of BMI (47.526). 

Question 3:

The goal of this analysis was to compare the population statistics of BloodPressure with the statistics obtained from bootstrap samples. 
Using bootstrap with replacement, 500 samples were created, each consisting of 150 observations.

The population mean of BloodPressure was found to be 69.1, while the population standard deviation was 19.34. The population 90th percentile was found to be 88.0.

The samples average mean of BloodPressure was found to be 69.20, with a standard deviation of 19.04. The samples average 90th percentile was found to be 87.36.

Comparing the statistics obtained from the population and the sample, it can be observed that the mean, standard deviation and 90th percentiles of population and samples data are fairly similar. 
Overall, the differences between the population and sample statistics are relatively small, suggesting that the sample is a representative subset of the population.
