<h3>Analysis of data visualizations:</h3>

<b>Bar Chart</b>: With the help of this visualization, it is now easier to see how the students are divided by gender. According to the given dataset, there are significantly more female students than male students.

<b>Pie Chart</b>: With the help of this visualization, it is now easier to see the test pass rate for each test. As can be seen, writing scores are slightly lower than math and reading.

<b>Scatter Plot</b>: With the help of this visualization, it is now easier to see the connection between math and reading scores. We can see that there is a correlation between the two, which suggests that reading scores typically increase as math results do.

<b>Box Plot</b>: With the help of this visualization, it is now easier to see the distribution of writing scores by race and ethnicity. We can see that the scores' medians and ranges differ slightly amongst the different groups, with group E's median and range having the greatest values.

<b>Histogram</b>: With the help of this visualization, it is now easier to see how math results are distributed throughout the dataset. The vast majority of the results, which fall between 60 and 80, show that the distribution is largely typical.
